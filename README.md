VICEboard
=========

The VICEboard enables you to connect your C64 keyboard (or one from the VIC20)
via bluetooth to a PC, Mac or Raspberry Pi. It uses the "positional" keyboard
mapping as defined by the [VICE emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/). So
you can use this keyboard to get an experience closer to the original machine.
It is recommended to use it with the SDL version, since the VICEboard offers
optional key combinations mapping to special keys, like "CTRL + F7" will send
"F12" to access the configuration menu.
